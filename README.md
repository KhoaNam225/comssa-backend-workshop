# FastAPI Backend Workshop Project

Welcome to the wild and wonderful world of backend development! This project is designed to help university students learn how to build a real-world API application using FastAPI and MongoDB. Think of it as your stepping stone from "What's an API?" to "I just built something that can handle thousands of requests!"

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop, you'll have:

- Built a lightning-fast REST API using FastAPI
- Connected your app to a cloud database (MongoDB Atlas)
- Deployed your creation to the internet for everyone to see

## Project Structure

This project follows a clean and simple structure:

- **main.py** - The heart of your API, where all the magic happens
- **models.py** - Where we define what our data looks like (data schemas)
- **database.py** - The bridge between your app and MongoDB
- **crud.py** - All the database operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **pyproject.toml** & **uv.lock** - Project configuration and dependencies
- **guides/** - Step-by-step tutorials to guide you through the journey

## Workshop Guides

The `guides/` folder contains three comprehensive tutorials that will take you from zero to hero. Follow them in order for the best learning experience:

### 1. üöÄ Setup FastAPI Project (`Setup_FastAPI_Project.md`)

Your first stop on this backend adventure! This guide walks you through:

- Installing Python and the super-fast `uv` package manager
- Setting up your development environment (no more "it works on my machine" problems)
- Creating your first FastAPI application
- Running and testing your API locally

Perfect for complete beginners - we assume you know how to turn on your computer and that's about it. The guide is packed with step-by-step instructions, troubleshooting tips, and enough encouragement to get you through any "why isn't this working?" moments.

### 2. üóÑÔ∏è Integrate with MongoDB (`Integrate_with_MongoDB.md`)

Time to give your API some memory! This guide covers:

- Setting up MongoDB Atlas (your database in the cloud)
- Connecting FastAPI to MongoDB
- Building CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Handling real data like a pro

Don't worry if databases seem scary - this guide breaks everything down into digestible chunks. You'll learn how to store and retrieve data without needing a PhD in computer science. Plus, MongoDB Atlas is free for student projects!

### 3. üåç Deploy FastAPI App (`Deploy_FastAPI_App.md`)

The grand finale - taking your app from localhost to the worldwide web! This guide teaches you:

- Preparing your app for deployment
- Using Render.com for free hosting
- Setting up environment variables securely
- Troubleshooting deployment issues

By the end, you'll have a live API that you can show off to friends, family, and potential employers. Fair warning: you might become addicted to the feeling of seeing your code running on the internet!

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Start with the `Setup_FastAPI_Project.md` guide in the `guides/` folder
3. Follow the guides in order - each one builds on the previous
4. Don't skip the testing steps (future you will thank present you)
5. Have fun! Building APIs is supposed to be exciting, not stressful

## Need Help?

Stuck on something? Don't panic! Every developer has been there (yes, even the ones with fancy titles). Check out the troubleshooting sections in each guide, or reach out to your workshop instructors.

Happy coding! üéâ
